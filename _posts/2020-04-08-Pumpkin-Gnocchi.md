    * 2 15 oz cans of pumpkin puree
    * 3 cups all purpose flour (plus more for the cutting board)
    * 1 tsp salt (and additional salt to taste)
    * Italian seasoning, to taste
    * Your favorite sauce

    1. Combine the pumpkin puree and all purpose flour in a bowl and mix with a wooden spoon. When enough flour has been mixed with the pumpkin, knead with your hands and form a big ball.
    2. Place the big ball onto a cutting board topped with a layer of flour and cut the ball into fourths. Bring a pot of water to boil on the stove.
    3. While the water is warming, flatten each quarter ball and cut into square-cut pieces (similar to a square-cut pizza). Take each piece and roll and fold into a gnocchi shape.
    4. When the water is boiling, add enough gnocchi such that the bottom layer of the pot is mostly covered. Do not add any more.
    5. After about three to four minutes, you should start seeing gnocchi rise to the top of the water. Once a gnocchi rises to the top, remove it from the pot and place in a nearby bowl. Continue to add uncooked gnocchi to the water as you remove cooked gnocchi. Repeat until finished.
    6. Add salt and Italian seasoning to taste.
    7. I personally like to cook these a little longer by searing them with some olive oil and 6 tbsp of butter on a pan. However, they can also be served right away with your favorite sauce as well!

I've been trying out some gnocchi recipes over the past few days. I was inspired by James Wythe's [Homemade Sweet Potato Gnocchi](https://healthylivingjames.co.uk/homemade-sweet-potato-gnocchi/?fbclid=IwAR3T7PBkUrjdAI57Uj7Kuud_Nx_jLsMQZUASQ6pAG06HEOvcpWBwGi9RoSg) which is an AMAZING and simple recipe. In fact, it's such a good recipe that my Italian mother (who used to make gnocchis with my Nonna when she was child) thought that they were some of the best gnocchis that she has ever had. I decided to adapt the recipe a little bit and try it with pumpkin filling since we had some leftover cans from Thanksgiving lying around in the cupboard. Because of the pumpkin puree's texture, it requires a lot more flour than the sweet potato gnocchis, so if you are looking for something lighter, I would check out James's recipe instead. Hope y'all enjoy!
