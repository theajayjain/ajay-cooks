Some of my favorite sandwiches that I have ever eaten are Indian sandwiches where chutney and onion dominate the flavor. These sandwiches, which I've had both in India and at chaat restaurants in the United States, are typically filled with onion, Amul cheese, tomatoes, chutney, and cucumbers. However, I felt that tomato and cucumbers don't necessarily help with the flavor of the sandwich. I decided to remove the tomato and cucumbers and replace it with Italian Marinara sauce. Furthermore, the Indian Amul cheese that is typically used is replaced with Italian mozzarella cheese (sorry my fellow Indians, I have a huge preference for Italian cheeses because of my Italian heritage). This sandwich combines the best flavors of India and Italy into a quickly made fusion grilled sandwich.
