Although this is not a traditional paneer recipe or dish that you will find in an Indian restaurant, it takes a lot of the same spices and ingredients that are found in Indian cooking. Its unique creamy taste similar to Pav Bhaji makes it one of my favorite Indian recipes.

This is a dish that I adapted from my former roommate and good friend Mike. He and I cooked this dish when we used to live in Washington DC and work on the Hill together.
