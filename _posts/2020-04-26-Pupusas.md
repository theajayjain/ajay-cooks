    1. Prepare refried beans according to directions.
    2. Pour masa flour and water in a bowl and mix together into a dough. The dough should be soft and slightly sticky. If you roll a tablespoon of the dough into a ball and the ball does not break apart or have deep cracks, then your dough mixture is perfect.
    3. Take a heaping tablespoon of dough and roll into a ball. Flatten the ball with your hands. Add a teaspoon of refried beans and top with some cheese. Close the edges on top of each other and shape into a ball. Flatten the ball again. Repeat until done with the dough.
    4. On a lightly oiled skillet, place papusas on medium-high heat for three minutes per side. Repeat until all papusas are done cooking. Serve with remaining beans, cheese, and salsa.

Pupusas are a staple of El Salvadorian cuisine and are quick and easy to make. They're quite filling and tasty. I first began to make these in the air fryer before moving to more traditional cooking methods. Pupusas are best served when they're topped with salsa, beans, and cheese.
