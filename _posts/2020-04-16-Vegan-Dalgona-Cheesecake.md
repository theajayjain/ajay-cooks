    * .8 cups vegan yogurt (I used actual yogurt)
    * 10 grams coconut oil
    * 5 tbsp maple syrup
    * 1 tsp vanilla extract
    * 1 Keebler Graham Pie Crust

  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Bring a pot of water to boil. Remove water from heat, place cashews in water, and let sit for fifteen minutes.
    2. In a blender, combine cashews, yogurt, coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract and blend until smooth. Take mixture and pour into pie crust, spreading evenly. Place in fridge for four hours.
    3. Combine instant coffee, sugar, hot water, and cornstarch into a bowl. Use a hand mixer or immersion blender to mix into a creamy dalgona texture. Take the dalgona topping and spread on top of the cheesecake filling.
    4. If texture is runny, freeze the cheesecake for one hour.
    5. Top cheesecake with any necessary powdered sugar (definitely required if you are using a stronger tasting instant coffee), whipped cream, and berries. Serve.

I've been getting into the dalgona trend lately and have been noticing some desserts popping up on my social feeds as well. I decided to try and create a dalgona vegan cheesecake which turned out pretty well (after we topped it with powdered sugar). The original coffee I was using was a Nescafe flavor that was not very strong in flavor. However, the Folgers instant coffee currently in my house was very strong! Once the strength of the coffee flavor was offset with powdered sugar, the sweetness of the coffee and tart taste of the cheesecake blended together perfectly. Make sure you taste the dalgona topping and the cheesecake filling before combining.
