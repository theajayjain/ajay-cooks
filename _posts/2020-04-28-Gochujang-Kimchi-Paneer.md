During a conversation I had with Youjung a couple weeks back, she mentioned that she felt Korean and Indian cuisine would not work together. I decided to prove her wrong and take on a mission of creating a dish that takes some of the best of Korean and Indian cuisine and combines it into one masterpiece. This Gochujang Kimchi Paneer is very similar to the Chili Paneers that you will find representing Indian and Chinese fusion all across India. However, because of the gochujang and kimchi, it has more of a fermented note than a tangy one.
