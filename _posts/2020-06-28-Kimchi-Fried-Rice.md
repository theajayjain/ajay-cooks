  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Cook rice per box directions.
    2. While waiting on rice to cook, combine tofu, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 0.5 olive oil, garlic powder, and gochugaru in a bowl. If you are using a non stick pan to cook the tofu, mix in corn starch. Let marinate for fifteen minutes.
    3. If you are using a non stick pan to cook the tofu, cook on non stick pan for six minutes, flipping after three minutes until evenly cooked. If you are using an air fryer, cook for 15 minutes at 375 degrees. Remove basket occasionally to shake tofu around for even cooking.
    4. Add 1 tbsp of olive or canola oil to a pan. Cook shallots for one minute, then add garlic and frozen vegetables and saute for three to five minutes. Remove from pan and place aside.
    5. In a nonstick pan, scramble the JUST egg on medium heat. When the liquid is poured in, scramble using a spatula and push the liquid towards the center of the pan until it begins to curd. Continue doing so for two to three minutes, then add remaining olive oil and rice.
    6. Combine rice and scrambled egg, then add the tofu, cooked vegetables, and kimchi until everything is warmed. Add preferred sauces to taste and serve.

This Kimchi Fried Rice dish is a very flexible dish. If you want, you can use an Instant Pot to cook your rice and an air fryer to cook the tofu. I was really excited to make this dish and use the JUST egg because it is essentially the Impossible Burger for the egg (it tastes just like egg but is completely vegan). However, be sure to use a nonstick pan for the JUST egg, you get a lot less scrambled egg if you use a stainless steel pan.
