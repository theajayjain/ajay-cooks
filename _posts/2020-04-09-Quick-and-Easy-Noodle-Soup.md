This noodle soup takes little to no time and can easily serve 4 people as a meal, or 6 people if you are serving with other food. All it takes is just two pots (one for the noodles and one for the soup) and 30 minutes of your time. It is an excellent quick meal to make when you are in a rush or want a soothing meal quickly. I like to add an extra tablespoon of sriracha, a teaspoon of soy sauce, and some lime juice to my serving, but you can customize yours however you want!
