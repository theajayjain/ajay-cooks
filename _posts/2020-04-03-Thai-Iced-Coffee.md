    * 2 tbsp instant Coffee
    * 2 tbsp brown sugar

    1. Add the instant coffee, brown sugar, and hot water into a bowl. Whisk for seven to ten minutes or mix for a few minutes with an electric hand mixer.
    2. Pour the milk between two glasses with ice. Add creamer for extra flavor if you desire.
    3. Pour the coffee mix on top of both glasses. You can slightly mix each glass for a better aesthetic or mix completely to truly immerse the flavors. I recommend mixing by pressing a spoon or straw down from the top of the drink to the bottom.
    4. Add a sprig of mint if you wish and serve.

I tried a whipped coffee recipe and made some modifications, but alas it did not turn out to the Instagram aesthetic I desired. However, the taste was amazing and reminded me of the Thai Iced Coffee at [Siam Noodle and Rice](https://www.yelp.com/biz/siam-noodle-and-rice-chicago) in Chicago. I decided to combine parts of the whipped coffee recipe and my own modifications to create a quick and easy Thai Iced Coffee that quickly and easily emulates the taste of Thailand.
