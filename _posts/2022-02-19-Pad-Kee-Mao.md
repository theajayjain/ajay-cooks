    * 16 oz [extra wide rice noodles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E5NIEKA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ([These noodles](https://www.foodservicedirect.com/nona-lim-pad-see-ew-noodles-11-ounce-8-per-case-21208945.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwnv71BRCOARIsAIkxW9EE-7mfdRcZW9ESd9IonolbcJnruDmLE_3P0oEaANneuVkGYfjcEX8aAkm5EALw_wcB) will also work. The noodles need to be very wide for this dish)
    * 12 oz firm tofu
    * 3 cloves garlic, minced
    * 3 bunches collards, chopped
    * 1 tsp vegetable oil
    * 12 oz bean sprouts
    * 5 tbsp [black bean sauce](https://usa.lkk.com/en/products/black-bean-sauce).
    * 7 tbsp [Thai style hot chili sauce](https://www.amazon.com/ABC-Extra-Chili-Sauce-Ounce/dp/B00Y3SNNYK). 
    * 3 tbsp Thai sweet chili sauce (similar to sauce for spring rolls)
    * Vegetarian oyster sauce (SEE RECIPE BELOW)
    * 3 tbsp soy sauce
      * .75 oz Thai basil (substitute normal basil if necessary)
    * 2 limes
    * Chili Garlic Sauce

    ## Vegetarian oyster (shiitake mushroom) sauce
    * 1 oz oz dried shiitake mushrooms
    * 2 tsp ginger chopped
    * .14 tsp salt + 4/3 tsp salt
    * .28 tsp soy sauce + 1/3 cup soy sauce
    * 1/2 cup water
    * Vegetable oil

    1. A couple hours before making the dish, soak dried shiitake mushrooms in 3/4 cup water.
    2. Remove mushrooms from the water and slice. Filter water through a sieve and save the water. On a stove on medium heat, cook shiitake mushrooms, ginger, and .14 tsp salt for four minutes. Add .28 tsp soy sauce and cook for one minute. Combine mushroom mixture, 4/3 tsp salt, 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup mushroom water, and blend. Add more water and continue blending if sauce is too thick. Set aside.
    3. Cut the tofu into cuboids as shown in the picture. Begin boiling a pot of water for noodles as well. In a non-stick pan with oil, fry on long side til golden brown and season with salt. Flip and fry again until golden brown.
    4. By this time the water should be boiling. Soak the noodles in room temperature water for five minutes, then add to boiling water for three minutes along with a teaspoon of oil. Immediately after adding noodles to boiling water, add oil and chopped collards in an wok or big pan and cook on medium heat for five minutes.
    5.  When noodles are al dente, turn off the pot of water but do not drain the noodles in order to prevent the noodles from massively sticking. Add 1/4 of your noodles, tofu, garlic, and bean sprouts with 5/4 tbsp of the black bean sauce, 7/4 tbsp Thai style hot chili sauce, 3/4 tbsp sweet chili sauce, and one fourth of the vegetarian oyster sauce. Mix and repeat adding noodles, tofu, vegetables, and sauces until all of each have been added.
    6. Add 3 tbsp soy sauce and mix. Reduce heat to low, add Thai basil, and mix. Serve after one minute. I highly recommend squeezing lime and adding a bit of chili garlic sauce to your pad kee mao as well.

Pad Kee Mao is easily in my top five favorite dishes of all time. It has an amazing combination of sweet, savory, spicy, and sour tastes that tantalizes every single one of your taste buds. I'm a huge fan of the Pad Kee Mao at [Siam Noodle and Rice](https://www.yelp.com/biz/siam-noodle-and-rice-chicago) in Chicago, but the other Thai restaurants I have been to have not come close to the Pad Kee Mao at my favorite restaurant. Furthermore, I felt that all of the websites I looked at for vegetarian pad kee mao did not do it justice. Every recipe either did not have enough sauce, was lacking in certain vegetables, or had the wrong noodles. Other Thai recipes and cookbooks came much closer but required seafood or meat. I decided to spend a couple hours intensively researching Siam Noodle and Rice's Pad Kee Mao ingredients as well as Thai cookbooks to create the ultimate vegetarian Pad Kee Mao. I hope y'all enjoy it, this truly is my favorite recipe. 

Two major points: Note this recipe serves a lot of people, so if you are planning on making it, I HIGHLY recommend using a big wok or halving this recipe down for smaller pots. In addition, the key to an excellent Pad Kee Mao are the last three ingredients in this recipe: Thai basic, chili garlic sauce, and lime. The three ingredients come together to add the perfect ratio of spice, sweetness, and sour taste.
