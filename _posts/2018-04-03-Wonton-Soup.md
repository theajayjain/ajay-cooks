    1. Combine ingredients for broth into a pot and start boiling on the stove on high heat.
    2. While the broth is getting ready to boil, combine all the ingredients for the dumplings (except for the wrappers) into a bowl and mix well.
    3. For each wrapper: wet the edges of the wrapper with water. Place 1 teaspoon of filling in the center. Fold the bottom left corner over to the top right corner to make a right angled triangle. Press down on edges so the dumpling will stick. Repeat for other wrappers.
    4. When the broth is boiling, reduce heat, place the dumplings in the broth, and simmer for 7 minutes. Serve.

This wonton soup is super easy to make and based off a potsticker recipe I used to make for my friends in high school. It follows a similar premise as the potsticker recipe, but instead of steaming, we cook the dumplings as part of a soup.
