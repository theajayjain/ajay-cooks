    1. Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees.
    2. In a bowl, combine flour, corn starch, corn meal, salt, 1 tbsp paprika, and 1 tsp smoked paprika. Mix. Add 2 tbsp water, mix, and repeat until the batter has a liquid texture.
    3. In a separate bowl, combine 4 tbsp mayo, 3 tbsp sriracha ketchup, and cholula. Mix. Add 1 tbsp smoked paprika. Mix together into our sauce.
    4. In a separate bowl, Crush Nacho Cheese Doritos until you have enough to fill 1/4 cup. Add bread crumbs and 1 tbsp paprika. Mix.
    5. Press paneer in a towel to squeeze out any excess water. Dunk a paneer slice into the wet batter, shake off excess batter, and coat into the dry batter until the Doritos mixture completely covers the paneer patty. Repeat for remaining paneer patties.
    6. Add patties to air fryer (you may have to air fry two at a time depending on the size of your fryer). Air fry for six minutes, flipping half way.
    7. On the top of each bun, add mayo mixture and lettuce. Then, add each paneer patty, the bottom bun, and flip over. Serve.

As my fellow Indians know, the McDonald's in India have some of the best fast food in the entire world. One of my favorite McDonald's options that is not available in the United States is the McSpicy Paneer, which consists of lettuce, spicy mayo, and a paneer patty on a bun. I adapted Anyone Can Cook With Me's [McSpicy Paneer recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71VqSl5Ljps&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=Anyonecancookwithme), but I decided to experiment with my air fryer because an air fried version of the McSpicy Paneer does not exist. This turned out perfectly, and brings me back to memories of waiting for my flight at New Delhi Airport chowing down on a McSpicy Paneer because it tasted way better than the airport lounge food.
