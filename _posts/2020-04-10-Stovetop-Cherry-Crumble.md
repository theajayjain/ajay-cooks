I adapted this recipe from Melissa Copeland's book [30 Minute Frugal Vegan Recipes](https://www.amazon.com/30-Minute-Frugal-Vegan-Recipes-Plant-Based-ebook/dp/B07KW1JQ5J/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2DKVGE0ZGVG3A&dchild=1&keywords=30+minute+frugal+vegan+recipes&qid=1585894818&sprefix=30+minute+frugal+%2Caps%2C171&sr=8-2), which has an AWESOME thirty minute microwavable apple crumble recipe. I decided to find a way to make cherry crumble instead so I could avoid using a microwave while utilizing less labor as well during the preparation of the filling. All that has to be done for the cherry crumble filling is heating frozen cherries on the stove. Enjoy!
