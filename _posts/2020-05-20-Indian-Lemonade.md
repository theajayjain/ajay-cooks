Whenever I travel to India, one of my favorite drinks to get are the lemonades and fresh lime sodas that are served in many establishments. I have not yet found a lemonade or lime soda that comes close to the ones in the United States but this recipe is an excellent substitute. I prefer my lemonades sour, so if you prefer sugary lemonades, I would recommend using less lemon juice or adding more sugar.
