    1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Whisk together butter and sugar until mixed completely. Add milk and mix completely. Add 1/4 cup of flour and mix completely. Repeat adding flour three more times. At this point, you should have a buttery, sugary dough. Spread this onto a 9" x 13" pan. Put in oven for 20 minutes.
    2. Combine lemon juice and cornstarch. Mix and set aside. In a pot, combine coconut cream, sugar, lemon zest, and lemon extract. Place pot on stove on medium heat for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Add lemon juice mixture to heat and stir for one and a half minutes until mixture thickens.
    3. Spread lemon filling onto the cookie crust and put in oven for 15 more minutes.
    4. Take lemon bars out of the oven and let cool at room temperature for one hour. Cut into bars and serve.

These are based on Alissa Saenz's amazing [Vegan Lemon Bars recipe](https://www.connoisseurusveg.com/vegan-lemon-bars/). I ended up making these vegetarian instead of vegan to make the ingredients cheaper and easier to find. I also added more cornstarch and omitted most of the lemon zest so the lemon filling would become thicker and less labor intensive to make. The main inspiration for her recipe comes from the vegan recipe that she made and she has other amazing recipes on her website as well!
