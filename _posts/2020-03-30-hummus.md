    1. Drain the chickpea cans and save the chickpea water for aquafaba if you wish to use it for other recipes.
    2. Remove the clear skin from the chickpeas. Although this takes a while, it results in a much smoother and creamier texture.
    3. Place all the ingredients in a food processor. Blend until smooth and creamy.
    4. Add additional lemon juice, oil, garlic, and seasonings as you see fit.

I recommend taking parts of the base hummus and making flavor modifications. On my website, I have a Sriracha and Black Label Reserve Habanero Hummus and a Roasted Red Bell Pepper Sauce Hummus.

I always love to give credit when credit is due. I used the initial recipe from [Eitan Bernath](https://www.eitanbernath.com/2019/07/08/fully-loaded-summer-hummus/) and modified it to my liking. He is an awesome cook who has an unparalleled passion for culinary arts. Please check his recipes out!
