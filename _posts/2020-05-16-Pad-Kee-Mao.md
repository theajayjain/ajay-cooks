    * 16 oz [extra wide rice noodles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E5NIEKA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ([These noodles](https://www.foodservicedirect.com/nona-lim-pad-see-ew-noodles-11-ounce-8-per-case-21208945.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwnv71BRCOARIsAIkxW9EE-7mfdRcZW9ESd9IonolbcJnruDmLE_3P0oEaANneuVkGYfjcEX8aAkm5EALw_wcB) will also work. The noodles need to be very wide for this dish)
    * 12 oz firm tofu
    * 3-4 dried red chillies
    * 2 cloves garlic, minced
    * 2 bunches collards, chopped
    * 12 oz bean sprouts
    * .75 oz Thai basil (substitute normal basil if necessary)
    * 5 tbsp [black bean sauce with garlic](https://www.amazon.com/Lee-Kum-Kee-Black-Garlic/dp/B0015GOI56/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=black+bean+sauce+with+garlic&qid=1589651626&sr=8-1). You can get this for much cheaper at a grocery store, but the product should look like this. I used the Kikkoman brand.
    * 7 tbsp [Thai style chili sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Kikkoman-Style-Chili-Sauce-9-3-Ounce/dp/B00FPN4RWE/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=thai+style+chili+sauce&qid=1589651765&s=grocery&sr=1-4). Also much cheaper at the grocery store.
    * 3 tbsp soy sauce
    * Lime (optional but highly recommended)
    * Chili Garlic Sauce (optional but recommended)
    ## Optional but recommended for a vegetarian oyster (shiitake mushroom) sauce
    * 0.5 oz dried shiitake mushrooms
    * 1 tsp ginger chopped
    * .07 tsp salt + 2/3 tsp salt
    * .14 tsp coconut aminos + 1/6 cup coconut aminos
    * 1/4 cup water
    * Vegetable oil
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. The night before making the dish, soak dried shiitake mushrooms in 3/4 cup water.
    2. Remove mushrooms from the water and slice. Filter water through a sieve and save the water. On a stove on medium heat, cook shiitake mushrooms, ginger, and .07 tsp salt for four minutes. Add .14 tsp coconut aminos and cook for one minute. Combine mushroom mixture, 2/3 tsp salt, 1/6 cup coconut aminos, 1/4 cup water, and blend. Set aside.
    3. Bring a pot of water to boil and prepare noodles according to directions. If you are using the first noodles I have attached, keep in mind that you will have to first soak the noodles in room temperature tap water for three minutes before boiling for five minutes. I recommend adding a little bit of oil when you add the noodles so the noodles do not stick.
    4. Cut the tofu into cuboids as shown in the picture. In a non-stick pan with oil, fry on long side til golden brown. Flip and fry again until golden brown.
    5. In an wok or big pan, add oil and chopped collards and cook on medium-high heat for two minutes. Add 1/4 of your noodles, tofu, garlic, and bean sprouts with a couple tbsp each of the black bean sauce, Thai style chili sauce, and vegetarian oyster sauce. Mix and repeat adding noodles, tofu, vegetables, and sauces until all of each have been added.
    6. Add soy sauce and mix. Reduce heat to low, add basil, and mix. Serve after one minute. I highly recommend squeezing lime and adding a bit of chili garlic sauce to your pad kee mao as well.

Pad Kee Mao is easily in my top five favorite dishes of all time. It has an amazing combination of sweet, savory, spicy, and sour tastes that tantalizes every single one of your taste buds. I'm a huge fan of the Pad Kee Mao at [Siam Noodle and Rice](https://www.yelp.com/biz/siam-noodle-and-rice-chicago) in Chicago, but the other Thai restaurants I have been to have not come close to the Pad Kee Mao at my favorite restaurant. Furthermore, I felt that all of the websites I looked at for vegetarian pad kee mao did not do it justice. Every recipe either did not have enough sauce, was lacking in certain vegetables, or had the wrong noodles. Other Thai recipes and cookbooks came much closer but required seafood or meat. I decided to spend a couple hours intensively researching Siam Noodle and Rice's Pad Kee Mao ingredients as well as Thai cookbooks to create the ultimate vegetarian Pad Kee Mao. I hope y'all enjoy it, this truly is my favorite recipe.
