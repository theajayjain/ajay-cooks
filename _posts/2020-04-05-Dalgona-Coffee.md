    1. Add the instant coffee, brown sugar, and hot water into a bowl. Use an immersion blender or hand mixer to mix together for one to two minutes. At this point, the mixture should have a creamy texture that should look like a very creamy peanut butter.
    2. Pour the milk between two glasses and then pour the coffee mix on top of both glasses.
    3. Take a picture of your photogenic drink. Mix with the milk before drinking.

This is my recipe for the trendy and photogenic coffee that has been going viral during the COVID-19 pandemic: dalgona coffee. Dalgona coffee has it roots from Rajasthan, India, where my family is from. However, it first went viral because of South Korean trends. I decided to upload my recipe because my best friend Youjung (who is Korean) have been having a debate about if Indian-Korean fusion would taste good, and I wanted to display evidence that Indian and Korean culinary concepts go well together!
