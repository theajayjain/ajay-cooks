    1. Be awesome friends for two years.
    2. Have the same stupid sense of humor, personality, and values.
    3. OPE
    4. Always be there for each other and have each other's backs.
    5. Make fun of people who put us down and bring each other back up.
    6. Have lots and LOTS of photoshoots (did I say lots?)
    7. Cook together and listen to records.
    8. Care for each other when the other is sick. Make a care package.
    9. Throw a fucking stuffed bunny in the other's face when they're sick and say "Happy Easter!"
    10. Sorry I forgot the next several steps, Youjung said too many jokes and I forgot what I was gonna say...
    11. To be fair, she also forgot what she was saying because I also said yet another joke that makes her laugh. Ope! Oh well
    12. You have a best friend and an amazing friendship, a five course meal. Serve.
