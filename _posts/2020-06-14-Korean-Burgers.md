The gochujang glaze marinates these burgers extremely well and you end up with an amazing spicy and somewhat sweet taste on your burger. I love eating the burger with some gouda cheese and a pretzel bun for an amazing taste. If you want, you could also top with some kimchi and a sprinkle of Korean chili powder as well.
