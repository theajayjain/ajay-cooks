    1. Cook the bottom half of the Beyond Burgers on the stove on medium-high heat for three minutes.
    2. Flip the burgers, add oil, mushrooms, and onions.
    3. Wait one minute then add the jalapeno peppers. Place your cheese slices on top of each patty.
    4. After two minutes, the cheese should be melted. Place the burgers onto the bottom halves of the pretzels buns.
    5. Assemble the burgers to your liking. I usually have the burgers on the bottom, dijon on top of the cheeseburger, and then jalapenos, onions, mushrooms and some lettuce, followed by the top bun.

I am a huge fan of both the Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger. Their release has made vegetarian and vegan options more widespread at restaurants across the country. More importantly, I can cook amazing burgers that blow the frozen veggie burgers out of the park. They appease both vegetarians and omnivores. I like to make my burgers more "high-end". After all, the ingredients are not that much more expensive and you're making $14-16 dollars for a quarter of the price!
