    1. In a bowl, combine all ingredients for the wontons except for the wrappers and mix well.
    2. For each wonton, take 1 tsp of filling and place in the center. Fold a corner diagonally to the other side of the wonton so the wonton is in the shape of a right triangle. Dip your finger and water and rub water around the edges of the wonton. Bring each corner together and slightly twist so the wonton is closed. Repeat for remaining filling and wonton wrappers.
    3. Combine vegetable broth, water, soy sauce, sriracha, lemon juice, and rice vinegar in pot and bring to boil. When soup is boiling, add wontons, remaining coleslaw mix/cabbage, and scallions. Reduce to simmer.
    4. After seven minutes, remove wonton soup from heat. Serve.

This wonton soup is easy to make and is just like what you will find in Chinese restaurants. Keep in mind that the recipe is quite spicy, so I would reduce the amount of sriracha in the recipe if you cannot handle spicy foods very well.
