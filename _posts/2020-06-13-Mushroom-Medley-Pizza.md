If you like mushrooms, you will love this mushroom medley pizza! I highly recommend using a more expensive tomato sauce or a homemade version - Rao's tomato sauce is typically 8 dollars a jar but is so much better than the 2 dollar jars you will find at the store. The exquisite flavors of the tomato sauce combine very well with the strength of the shiitake mushroom to form an excellent pizza.
