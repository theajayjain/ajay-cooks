    1. Combine sauce ingredients and blend. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
    2. Add olive oil to nonstick pan and set on medium heat. Saute onions for two minutes, then add refried beans, mushrooms, cheese, and powders. Cook for three minutes or until mushrooms have softened.
    3. Warm tortillas so they do not crumble during assembly. I recommend placing tortillas in a Ziploc bag, rubbing them on the outside and on some of the inner tortillas with water (using your hand), and then microwaving for one minute. You can also warm the tortillas in the oven for four minutes.
    4. In your casserole dish, spread 1/2 to 3/4 cup of your sauce on the bottom. Dip a tortilla into the sauce, spread 2 slightly heaping tsp of filling down the center of the tortilla, and bring the left and right edges together. Repeat until all enchiladas have been assembled. Add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of sauce on the bottom of any subsequent casserole dishes that you need.
    5. Pour remaining enchilada sauce on top of enchiladas and bake in oven for fifteen minutes.
    6. Top with any recommended toppings and serve.

This enchilada recipe is quick and very tasty (with a lot of help from the chipotle chili powder which provides a slight smoky taste to the enchiladas). I got the inspiration for the sauce from [Feasting At Home](https://www.feastingathome.com/quick-enchilada-sauce/) and the idea to fill the enchiladas in such a way that they would not break from Eddie Garza's [Â¡Salud! Vegan Mexican Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/%C2%A1Salud-Vegan-Mexican-Cookbook-Mouthwatering/dp/1623157781).
