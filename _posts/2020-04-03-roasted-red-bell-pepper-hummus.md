    1. If you have not done so already, make the hummus as stated in my earlier recipe. You can also substitute in store bought hummus.
    2. Cut the red bell pepper in half vertically. Remove the guts, membranes, and seeds. Press the peppers down with the skin facing up until the inner part of the pepper is lying nearly flat on a baking sheet.
    3. On the baking sheet, place your unpeeled garlic clove(s).
    4. Broil the pepper and garlic for 13-15 minutes. You will notice that broiling is complete when the pepper is starting to char and decent parts of the skin will be blackened.
    5. Remove the peppers and garlic from the oven. Place the peppers in a bowl and cover for five minutes so they can cool and steam.
    6. Peel the skin off the peppers. Place the peppers and garlic into a blender and puree. Add the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and salt and continue to puree.
    7. Mix the sauce with your hummus and serve.

One of my favorite sauces is a Roasted Red Bell Pepper Sauce recipe by Melissa Copeland. The recipe is made as part of her Roasted Red Bell Pepper Pasta recipe in her book [30 Minute Frugal Vegan Recipes](https://www.amazon.com/30-Minute-Frugal-Vegan-Recipes-Plant-Based-ebook/dp/B07KW1JQ5J/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2DKVGE0ZGVG3A&dchild=1&keywords=30+minute+frugal+vegan+recipes&qid=1585894818&sprefix=30+minute+frugal+%2Caps%2C171&sr=8-2). It is an awesome cookbook that got me through my senior year of college (I highly, highly recommend the 30 minute ramen recipe, you won't go back to eating prepackaged ramen after trying this recipe).

All the steps for creating the sauce are based off her directions, but I modified the amount of ingredients and increased the proprtion of balsamic vinegar so it would better fit the taste and texture of the hummus. I hope you guys enjoy (and hope you all get a copy of Melissa Copeland's cookbook - it sincerely is amazing)!
