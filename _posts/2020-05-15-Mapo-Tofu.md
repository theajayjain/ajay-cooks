As you all know, one of my favorite dishes is mapo tofu. I even did a speech about it in a Mandarin speech contest during high school. One of my favorite mapo tofu recipes is the version from the [New York Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017358-vegan-mapo-tofu). My mapo tofu recipe is a slight modification from the New York Times recipe. This recipe omits the shiitake mushrooms and mushroom broth and replaces it with meat substitutes from Beyond Meat and Impossible Meat instead. One of my closest friends LOVES mapo tofu but dislikes mushrooms more than almost anything in the entire world, so I decided to make a mapo tofu recipe that we can both enjoy.
