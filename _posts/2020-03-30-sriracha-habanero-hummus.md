Growing up, I loved to eat spicy food and would often test the limits of my taste buds. One of my favorite concoctions was mixing hot sauces together with Hummus and serving it with pretzel crisps. Over time, I've found that Sriracha and El Yucateco Black Label Reserve Habanero Sauce are the two best combinations because of their exquisite flavors. Thankfully, spicing up your hummus is extremely easy!
